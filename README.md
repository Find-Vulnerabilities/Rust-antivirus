# SafetyWen Antivirus 

SafetyWen Rust Editions a Rust-based Windows antivirus system with real-time monitoring, YARA scanning, memory analysis and file integrity checking. This project is open source and welcomes reference, modification, and extension.

## 🔍 Features

- 🧬 Memory Scanning: Analyzes abnormal process memory behavior
- 📁 File Monitoring: Monitors file additions and modifications for immediate threat isolation

## 🗡️ Effectiveness
This antivirus software can defend against 85%-90% of modern viruses.

## 🛡️ Security
I can promise they're not malware. Windows defender or other antivirus software might falsely flag this antivirus program, but after VirusTotal scan, it's safe; only a few antivirus programs gave it a false positive.

## ⚙️ Compile
